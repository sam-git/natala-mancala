Mancala Game in Java. Designed to be easily configurable. 
It started out as a uni project that I just kept working on.

Using MVC pattern, new views other than ASCII can be created.
Using the property files in 'asciiProperties' and 'gameProperties' respectively, the ascii output and rules of the game can easily be changed.
